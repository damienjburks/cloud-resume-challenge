He is patient beyond his years, open-minded, insightful, charismatic, thankful, humble, and enjoyable to work with while remaining wildly productive.  He is the guy you want on your team when things need to get done, especially if the solution you are pursuing requires new languages and concepts.  He is one of the fastest self-motivated people I've ever met and requires zero hand-holding while remaining loyal to his own expectations of quality (which are probably way higher than any company's).  Damien's career and skillset have no limit and anyone would be a fool not to hire him.  As a personal note, Damien, if you haven't started your own company five years from now, I'm going to personally berate you on LinkedIn.  You're great at making the ideas of normal men look brilliant.  Imagine what you could do unfettered."
